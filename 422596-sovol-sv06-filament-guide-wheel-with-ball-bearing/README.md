# Sovol SV06 Filament Guide Wheel with Ball Bearing

<p>I don't use the filament holder as I have all my filament in dryboxes next to the printer, so I used to only use it to guide the filament. When printing fast enough, the filament grinding on the spoolholder made a distressing noise, so I came up with this simple wheel that guides the filament.</p><p>Thanks to Sovol releasing all the Step files, it was as simple as modifying the filament holder, keeping the locking mechanism and just adding a wheel.</p><h3>Extra parts</h3><ul><li>M3x12 countersunk screw</li><li>608 ball bearing</li></ul><h3>Printing</h3><ul><li>Choose either the simple &nbsp;cap or the cap with shield. With the simple cap, you just throw the filament on there, but long retractions might cause the filament to fall off the wheel.&nbsp;</li><li>â‰¤ 0.2mm Layer Height (especially the thread for the barrell and the wheel will benefit from smaller layers)</li><li>Support: Yes for the locking barrel (use a higher XY distance (~0.5mm) so it's easy to remove)</li><li>Slicing Tolerance: Exclusive (the dimensions for the 608 ball bearing are a tight fit, and the barrel is taken directly from sovol)</li></ul><h3>Assembly</h3><ol><li>Press the ball bearing into the wheel (only fits from one side)</li><li>Mount the wheel onto the barrel</li><li>Add the cap you chose and screw tight with the M3 screw</li><li>Unmount the original filament holder (keep the locking piece)</li><li>Mount the new wheel</li></ol>
